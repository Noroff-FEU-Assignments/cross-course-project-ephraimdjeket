An online shop selling men's and women's rain jackets.

## Description

Rainy days is an online shop selling jackets for men and women. The target audience is between the age of 30 to 50.

The purpose of this project is to showcase the skills and knowledge I've acquired during my first year of front-end development studies at Noroff. The task was to develop an online shop site using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. As I progressed in my studies, I revisited this project, replacing some of the hardcoded HTML with DOM manipulation techniques.

You can add some bullet points if you'd like to:

- Semantic HTML
- DRY Principle
- API data fetching

## Built With
