Rainydays Course Assignment Report:

Html/Css written files for my Rainydays course project. Visual studio code was used as text editor and git bash to upload my files to the github classroom repo. 
Adobe Photoshop was used to edit some photos. The CA project has two CSS files and two navigation tags in the header. The reason for this is because I first
started working on the desktop version of my website and I later decided to start from mobile as it's a common practice to do so. I acknowledge that this is not
the best approach to this. There's also a vertical scrollbar in the hamburger menu, which one of the teachers gave me feedback on how to solve, but it didn't work
for me.
