Rainydays Course Assignment Report:

Html/Css written files for my Rainydays course project. Visual studio code was used as text editor and git bash to upload my files to the github classroom repo. 
Adobe Photoshop was used to edit some photos. The CA project has two CSS files and two navigation tags in the header. The reason for this is because I first
started working on the desktop version of my website and I later decided to start from mobile as it's a common practice to do so. I acknowledge that this is not
the best approach to this. There's also a vertical scrollbar in the hamburger menu, which one of the teachers gave me feedback on how to solve, but it didn't work
for me. 

There were a few things that I found complicated, like the menu overlay. I always attempted to do things myself first, and then when stuck, I'd either ask teacher/students for help
or use stackoverflow/youtube and search on how to solve the specific problems I had to resolve my issues. I was not able to find all answers to my problems, but I did the best I could.

Javascript 1 (Updated)
After learning some basic javascript, we were tasked to:

1. Look through your website and assess where API calls need to be made to dynamically add content. You should have a products page and a product details page, but there might be other pages like the home page where products are loaded.

2. Remove the hardcoded products from the HTML.

3. Fetch the products from the API and dyncamically add them to the page with links to the product details page. Use the ID as a query string parameter so that on the product details page you know which item has been clicked on.

4. On the product details page make a request to the API for the specific data for the product that the user has clicked on.

5. Add loading indicators when making API calls.

6. Ensure proper error handling.

7. Test the site.

8. Remove console.logs youâ€™ve been using for testing.

9. Deliver the link to your site and your repository.

VS Code editor extensions used:
- Live server to deploy local version of website
- Prettier for code formatting
